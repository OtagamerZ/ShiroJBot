My commands can be found under the menu `%1$shelp`, but should you have any questions feel free to ask directly at this channel, my support team will answer as soon as possible.\n\
\n\
By default, spawning cards and drops are disabled, should you choose to use them type `%1$ssetkawaipon`/`%1$ssetdrop` at the channels where they should appear.\n\
\n\
If you want, you can change my language using the command `%1$slocale` (available: `PT`, `EN`).\n\
